This project is a repertoir of playbooks, task and other definitions used with the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started) automation framework. Tasks defined here can be imported as a Git Submodule and reused across projects with similar requirements in their build and deployment methodologies. The central usage scenario assumed by the authors is developing a web application locally and publishing to a virtual private server or cloud server instance. The configuration was put together for use with DigitalOcean, though it should function with other Linux-based servers, as well.
